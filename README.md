# FocusFlow - Minimalist Productivity Tool


FocusFlow is a clean, distraction-free productivity tool designed to help you focus on what truly matters - your work, study, and personal growth. Built with intentional simplicity, it provides just the essential features you need without the clutter of bloated apps. Part of my [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/dipanshu447/100-days-of-reactjs) challenge journey.

### My Learning Journey
This project represents my first fully-developed React application, created during my [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/dipanshu447/100-days-of-reactjs) challenge. Here's what I gained:

- Mastered React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Advanced React state management techniques
- Browser Notification API implementation
- Clean UI/UX design principles
- Developed custom progress tracker
- Responsive layout strategies
- Practiced clean component architecture

## Technologies Used

- React.js with Vite for fast development
- Vanilla CSS for clean, lightweight styling
- Browser APIs (Notifications, Local Storage)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
